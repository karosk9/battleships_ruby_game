# battleships_ruby_game
Written in Ruby console battleship game

There is only one player. Game counts how many times player needs to hit to win.

It is my first a bit more complicated app. 
I am consious that many code is not perfect, but it works and I am going to improve it soon!

How to start
1. Clone app
git clone git@github.com:karosk9/battleships_ruby_game.git

2. Enter directory 
cd battleships_ruby_game

3. Run the game
ruby play_game.rb

Enjoy!
